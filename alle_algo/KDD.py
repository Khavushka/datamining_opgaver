The KDD (Knowledge Discovery in Databases) process model consists of several steps for extracting useful information from large datasets. While Python provides various libraries and tools for each step of the KDD process, implementing the entire process model in a single Python code is a complex task. However, I can provide an overview of the general steps involved in the KDD process and mention some Python libraries commonly used for each step:

Data Selection: Choose relevant data from the available dataset.

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the selected data.

Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
Data Transformation: Transform the preprocessed data into appropriate forms for further analysis.

Python libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas.
Data Mining: Apply various data mining techniques and algorithms to discover patterns and knowledge from the transformed data.

Python libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Pattern Evaluation: Evaluate and interpret the discovered patterns to determine their significance and usefulness.

Python libraries: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.
Knowledge Presentation: Visualize and present the discovered knowledge in a meaningful way.

Python libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly.
Keep in mind that the KDD process is iterative, and you may need to revisit previous steps based on the results and insights gained at later stages.

It's important to note that implementing the KDD process model in its entirety requires a combination of domain knowledge, expertise in data analysis, and familiarity with the relevant Python libraries and tools. The choice of specific libraries and tools may vary depending on the specific requirements of your dataset and analysis goals.

# Step 1: Data Selection
# Assume we have a dataset named 'data.csv' with features 'feature1' and 'feature2'

# Step 2: Data Preprocessing
# Remove any missing values

# Step 3: Data Transformation
# Perform feature scaling
scaler = StandardScaler()
scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(data[['feature1', 'feature2']])

# Step 4: Data Mining
# Apply K-means clustering
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)

cluster_labels = kmeans.labels_

# Step 5: Pattern Evaluation
# Assess cluster quality
silhouette_score = metrics.silhouette_score(scaled_data, cluster_labels)

# Step 6: Knowledge Presentation
# Visualize the clusters
